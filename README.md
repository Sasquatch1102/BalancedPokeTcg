# BalancedPokeTcg
I tried balancing the Pokemon Trading Card game for Game Boy Color, here are all the changes I made

# Card Changes
Bulbasaur;
Hp 40 -> 50
Added Energy Spike: 2 Colorless
  Search your deck for a basic Energy card and attach it to 1 of your Pok√©mon. Shuffle your deck afterward.
Leech Seed Cost changed to 1 Grass, 1 Colorless
